# Country Names

Inspired by an article on Quartz, ["Nearly every country on earth is named after one of four things"](https://qz.com/1070266/the-name-of-a-country-can-only-really-mean-one-of-four-things/) by [Thu-Huong Ha](https://qz.com/author/thaqz/)

This map puts together all data summarized in the article and what I collected from other sources.
